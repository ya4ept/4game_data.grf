For all of you, who have faced some problems with loot for dancer and alchemist job quests: please, update the game. Here is a little fix for quest journal. Just ignore what NPC requires and follow the Quest Journal. There you can find correct loot which is required for these two job quests.
NPCs will be fixed during the next MA.
Thank you!

As you can see we have got a small client update.
If you've faced some issues with NPC please check Quest Journal, not NPC dialogue window. In the Quest Journal you can find correct information about the loot that is required.
The problem itself will be solved by next MA.
Thank you for your reports!
