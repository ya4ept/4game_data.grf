For all of you, who have faced some problems with loot for dancer and alchemist job quests: please, update the game. Here is a little fix for quest journal. Just ignore what NPC requires and follow the Quest Journal. There you can find correct loot which is required for these two job quests.
NPCs will be fixed during the next MA.
Thank you!
