We just uploaded one extra client patch after the maintenance one. This one fixes the inventory window and the possibility to resize it.

It is finally here, the time has come for the Closed Beta Test of Ragnarok Online Prime!
The server is now open for all players that purchased pre-order packs to test out all the new features of Prime and help us understand what necessary adjustments must be made before the official opening of the game.

Want to participate too? You still have time to buy our pre-order packs to play our CBT and get a bunch of items including exclusive costumes! Check https://eu.4game.com/roprime/preorders/
